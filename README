Zealthy MiniEMR – Full Stack Healthcare Management System by Nishad Kolhe

With Zealthy MiniEMR I have created a lightweight Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system designed for healthcare providers to manage patients, appointments, and prescriptions efficiently. 
This project demonstrates a complete full-stack implementation with Django REST API backend and a React frontend.

Features I have added - 
 
  Patient Management: Add, view, and edit patient details including name, email, and credentials.

  Appointment Scheduling via Admin: Schedule one-time or recurring appointments for patients. Supports weekly and monthly recurrence patterns.

  Prescription Management: Add, edit, and track prescriptions with dosage, quantity, refill dates, and schedules.

  Admin Interface: Secure admin dashboard to manage patients, appointments, and prescriptions in a single view.

  API-first Architecture: Fully RESTful API for all backend operations, easily extendable for mobile apps or other clients.



Tech Stack I used - 

  Backend: Django 4.2, Django REST Framework

  Frontend: React, React Router, Axios for API calls

  Database: SQLite (for development) / PostgreSQL (for production-ready deployment)

  Deployment:

      Backend: PythonAnywhere

      Frontend: Netlify

Documentation - 
  I have added my SDLC process documents within the repo
